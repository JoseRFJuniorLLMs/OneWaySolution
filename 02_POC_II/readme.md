Overview
---

> Build a Machine Learning solution that can be taught by the end user. Files must be classified as Ação, Grupo Assunto, Assunto based on theirs words, they must be given as input, extracted its words, processed with this engine and their classication should be the output. The module must allow corrections on the results and retroative data as well, thus any file classification should be recorded. All correction must be followed by the new accuracy value of the model.
